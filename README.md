# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Simulations

This repository contains practical cybersecurity simulations I’ve completed to build hands-on experience in defensive security. Each folder represents a real-world-inspired scenario focused on areas like threat investigation, risk assessment, and incident response.

## 📁 Included Projects

### 🔐 [APT34 Breach Investigation & Risk Assessment](./apt34-breach-risk-assessment)  
Simulated a targeted breach by APT34, researched the threat actor’s TTPs, and conducted a cybersecurity risk assessment using standard frameworks.

More simulations will be added as I progress in my cybersecurity journey.
